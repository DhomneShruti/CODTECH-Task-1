**OVERVIEW**

1.*Import Necessary Modules*:You'll need tkinter for the GUI components and functions, and possibly other modules depending on your approach.

2.*Create the GUI*: Design a simple interface using tkinter that includes:

    -Entry widgets for users to input numbers.
    
    -Buttons for different arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
    
    -Another Entry widget or Label to display the result.

3.*Define Functions*: Create functions that will perform the arithmetic operations when the user clicks the corresponding button:

    -Addition (+)
    
    -Subtraction (-)
    
    -Multiplication (*)
    
    Division (/)
    
4.*Event Handling*: Use event handling to link the buttons to their respective functions. When a button is clicked, it should retrieve the numbers from the Entry widgets, perform the operation, and display the result in the result widget.

5.*Error Handling*: Consider handling cases like division by zero or non-numeric inputs gracefully to provide a better user experience
